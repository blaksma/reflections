What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/paa-pce/Udacity/reflections/.git/
A new git project is created and initialized. We need to do it to track all the files that we need.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate buffer to collect data from working directory and to store it in repository.
